                            <p>&ldquo;That was frustrating because sometime they say you cant take this class because its reserved for certain students. But I was told I could take online classes, I was told I could take them but then you click them and it was like, &ldquo;no this is reserved,&rdquo; and you have to go the head of the department to ask for it. That&rsquo;s very frustrating. If I should want to take online classes I should be able to take online classes.&rdquo;<br />
                            <br />
                            &ldquo;I guess like sometimes when I want to find very specific things, its very difficult to find. Like lets say I wanted to look at a specific organization on campus, but like something in that organization. You have to go to the UNT website and then you have to go find that organization and then you have to go and find that specific topic about that organization.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;I am here on a scholarship, so I need to work hard and focus on my degree to get the best I can out of UNT. My Work Study at the cafeteria helps me keep my scholarship. I haven&rsquo;t found it hard to adjust to life here since life back home was harder, with me being responsible for a number of chores other than school.&rdquo;<br />
                            <br />
                            &ldquo;I found the tour here at UNT very helpful in deciding on this University, other than the scholarships I received, since I realized that it was a diverse crowd here, which was what I wanted. The tour guides themselves were diverse, and the tour was quite informative.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;I choose UNT for it&rsquo;s technical communication program. I want to develop my skills as a writer and eventually open my own consulting firm. I belong to the local STC, but I do not feel it is enough for to meet my end goals. I would like to get some help with being a role model, and I need to learn how to do more with computers.&rdquo;<br />
                            <br />
                            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really involved in like sororities or have gone to a football game, but I don&rsquo;t go because I live off campus. I think living off campus hurts me socially because I don&rsquo;t get the opportunity to meet a lot of people and I&rsquo;m really involved with that kind of stuff. Most of the stuff is in the evening, and I drive to and from school everyday.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>&ldquo;Yeah, there were other universities I looked at; I got admits from two of them, and even though the other one was good, I wasn&rsquo;t sure I would be given as extensive employment opportunities while I&rsquo;m in my program. I thought that UNT had the best one among the two others, so that&rsquo;s why I came here.&rdquo;<br />
                            <br />
                            &ldquo;There were a lot of options for on-campus employment which basically helps a lot of international students in their living here.&rdquo;</p>
