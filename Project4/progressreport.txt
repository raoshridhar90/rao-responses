Progress Report
I’m sorry to report that my progress on Project 4 is minimal, at best. I have a set of 4 deliverables, out of which, I have researched for two of these. My project is teaching tutorials for video editing on CyberMedia PowerDirector, which is a slightly more powerful tool as compared to Windows Live Movie Maker.
My four deliverables are:
1. A set of YouTube tutorials.
2. Scripts for these individual videos.
3. Audience analysis for my project.
4. A list of best practices for video tutorials.
I have researched best practices video tutorials for my project. It seemed interesting and I have a question for you, Dr. Lam, regarding these. I was wondering if the best practices for the tutorials applied to the making of the video itself or who it was targeted to. If you could help me with that perspective, that would be great. Or, do I just include both in the best practices? I think both are applicable for this project, since it is a Technical Communication project.
I have started learning CyberMedia PowerDirector, and it seems I can do that in a few more days, after which I can start the video tutorials. I will get started on the Audience Analysis part as soon as I can, and that might be the most manageable part of my project.
I have looked at some of the video editing functions on PowerDirector, and have narrowed it down to some that the trial version supports, and which will be effective in doing more than just cutting and pasting videos. I have also started looking for free, non-copyrighted videos online which I can use for my demonstration. I have found a few sites with that regard, and I’m narrowing it down to some interesting videos.
