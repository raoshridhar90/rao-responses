                    <h3>Incoming International Students FAQs</h3>
                    <p>Welcome incoming freshman. Adjusting to college life can sometimes be a difficult transition to make. Moving away from home, acquiring new friends, adapting to a new environment, and developing skills for a new way of learning can all be difficult and sometimes stressful. This site is designed to help first-time students alleviate some of the stresses involved transiting to college life.<br />
                    <br />
                    We take this approach by breaking everything down into four groups, Academics, Campus Life, College Life, and UNT Systems.

                                <h3>How challenging are the programs offered at UNT?</h3>

There are 11 undergraduate and graduate colleges, and UNT is host to numerous accomplishments which demonstrates our excellence in academics. For a list of UNT first go to <a href="https://www.unt.edu/did-you-know.htm">Did You Know</a> page.<br />
                                <br />
                                <b>Freshman and Transfer Students</b><br />Students looking to attend UNT can look at any of the programs available by going to any of the Colleges and Schools websites located on the UNT website, under Academics tab. There are currently ten college programs and three school programs for undergraduates. For students looking for more of a challenge, they can look into UNT&rsquo;s Honors College.<br />
                                <br />For freshman entering into Honors College, they must score at least 1200 on math and verbal sections of the SAT or at least 27 on the ACT. In addition to high test scores they must be within the top 20 percent of their graduating class with a GPA of at least 3.75 (on a 4.0 scale), and submit an essay.<br />
                                <br />
                                Transfer students enter into Honors College must have at least a 3.35 GPA on all college work no more than 72 credit hours taken by the first semester, and must adhere to the goals and practices of Honors College.<br />
                                <br />
                                <b>Master&rsquo;s Students</b><br />Many of the graduate programs are rated among the Texas&rsquo; and nation&rsquo;s best. The median class size is about 8. We are host to leading researchers, and have 44 research centers and institutes. We have a nationally recognized digital library program. Our library is a backup to the nation&rsquo;s library systems, which makes it ideal for research purposes.<br />
                                <br />
                                The courses are challenging, but it differs from one person to the next and on course load. There are a lot of international graduate students, mostly in engineering, and the course load here can be challenging if you take too many courses at once. The courses can also depend on the professor and how challenging he/she make their courses. Some courses might focus only on academics and not on projects, some might only focus on projects and not have any exams.</p>

                                Some notable programs that UNT is most proud of is our Arts and Science programs. We hold more concerts and art exhibits than most other universities. We have a world renowned music program, and we were one of the first universities to implement Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science (TAMS) programs, which targets student who excel in science and mathematics programs in high school. <br />
                                <br />
                                UNT has a lot to choose from. What will be your choice? </p>

                                <h3>What credits will UNT accept?</h3>
                                <p>Transferring from a community college to a four year program can sometimes be nerve racking. Often times people will find out that they spent all this time in a program only to see very few if any of their credits earned will transfer.<br />
                                <br />
                                As an undergrad you can compare your course work with the degree programs available at UNT. Simply go to the Office of the Registrar page. In the section marked For the Student, select  <a href="http://registrar.unt.edu/resource-plans">Transfer Student Resources</a>. If you are still in high school or just starting out and think about coming to UNT, you can use this page to map out the courses you would need to take at a community college for credit at UNT. You can explore all your options from this point. Texas uses a Texas Common Course Number System that allows universities to cross reference course work completed. This comes in handy when you are attending a small town community college and then transfer into a behemoth system like UNT. Also some high schools offer dual credit courses, these are a good way for students to save money on tuition; however, not all dual credit courses are transferable. You will have to check with the registrar to see which courses from your school will be accepted.<br />
                                <br />
                                Other things to consider have to deal with what UNT will accept. For undergraduate degrees, it comes down to your scores and number of hours you are transferring in from an accredited program. For transfer students, international students, and Master&rsquo;s students, UNT will admit students based on whether they have a suitable undergraduate degree or not, and based on other application requirements.<br />
                                <br />
                                Credit requirements for Master&rsquo;s students at UNT requires a minimum of 120 hours of undergraduate coursework for the application to even be considered. The undergraduate should be as relevant as possible as the graduate degree you’re applying to. If you get your undergraduate degree in Art History, but you want to pursue a Master&rsquo;s degree in Physics, UNT will find it hard to accept you as a candidate for their Physics program. You would either have to take some lower level courses, or show relevant work related experience to be accepted into the program.<br />
                                <br />
                                Interdepartmental courses like Professional and Technical Communication requires you to have basic writing proficiency in order to be even considered for the program.<br />
                                <br />
                                Credits for international institutions will be accepted based on how accredited the college is in that country. If it is a college that hasn&rsquo;t been accredited by that state in that country, then the undergraduate degree is deemed unacceptable.</p>

                                <h3>How diverse is the student body at UNT?</h3>
                                <p>When you first walk on campus you will notice something special about UNT. What is it you might ask? Well, it&rsquo;s our student body. We have a rather diverse population of students from all around the world who attend UNT. Each year this diverse population doubles and triples within certain ethnic groups. The reason for this boils down to the general nature of acceptance. We welcome everyone with open arms. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what your ethnic, sexual orientation, physical, or political backgrounds are, and UNT accepts them all. We believe there is no better way to learn than to draw from the vast experiences our world population has to offer.<br />
                                <br />
                                When it comes to diversity, UNT is at the top of the list. More countries from around the world send their students to UNT than they do the winter Olympics (132 countries represented at UNT, 88 countries represented at the last winter Olympics).  But it doesn&rsquo;t stop there, no, UNT is in the nation&rsquo;s top 50 colleges graduating the most African American and Hispanic Students. We have over 16,000 ethnic minorities, and nearly 2,000 international students. Our student body is 44% ethnically diverse, and our faculty is 29%.  But those are just numbers, we support a great deal of programs that encourage community across the campus. <br />
                                <br />
                                We know that the transition to college life can be hard, especially if you are coming from another country, which is why we have several programs in place to help students make their transition a smooth one.<br />
                                <br />
                                We have the <a href="http://studentaffairs.unt.edu/access-mentoring-program">ACCESS Mentoring Program</a>, which matches new students with a mentor who provide guidance and support as you make your transition to college life.<br />
                                <br />
                                Next we have a Buddy System, which is sponsored by the UNT&rsquo;s <a href="https://edo.unt.edu/multicultural-center">Multicultural Center</a> as a peer mentoring program for first-year students, according to ethnic or cultural background and gender. Finally, we have over 400 student organizations, 29 ethnic, 35 religious, and two LGBT which allow students to get involved.

                                <h3>What kind of fees should I expect to pay?</h3>
                                <p>The fees you should expect to pay depend on a lot of different factors. Are you a high school graduate? Did you graduate near the top of your class? Are you registering as an in-state or Oklahoma resident or out-of-state, or are you an international student? Where you are from help determines how much you will pay. How you plan on paying for school can add extra expenses to your tuition.  Depending on the options you choose, such as traditional tuition plan or Eagle Express tuition plan (undergraduates only) you could end up paying $20 more per semester hour. If you have to take placement exams, academic fees, laboratory fees and at least 13 other core fees that add to your over all expenses. Some courses have additional fees, these fees are not available until you sign up for the course.<br /> 
                                <br />

                                Don&rsquo;t fret though, there are numerous means of paying for college. One such way is to fill out FASFA. FASFA can be used to find low interest loans, scholarships, and grants.  You can even ask your local community for financial aid to help off-set the cost of college. UNT does offer some waivers and exemptions providing you meet certain criteria. For a detailed explanation of these waivers and exemptions refer to <a href="https://studentaccounting.unt.edu/waivers-and-exemptions">Student Waivers and Exemptions.</a>  If you don&rsquo;t fall into any of these categories or if you still have expenses and need a loan UNT can help you out there too.

                                <h3>What are the benefits to living on campus?</h3>
                                <p>Living on campus can be a rewarding experience for new students. You can look at it like a safety net, the first time you are away from your parents, new added responsibilities without all the angst that comes along with renting an apartment for the first time.<br /> 
                                <br />
                                Granted, like living at home, there are rules that all students must adhere to, but these rules won&rsquo;t get you grounded, they are more or less put in place for your safety and all your new roommates&rsquo; safety. Things like, no hotplate, candles, microwaves, and extension cords are allowed. You can have power strips that have surge protectors on them. <br />
                                <br />
                                Here are some of the amenities you can get from living in a dorm:
                                <ul> 
                                    <li>Free use of washer and dryers. If you were renting an apartment, you would have to pay for laundry services.</li>
                                    <li>Free cable connections. Again, this is about $50 a month if you were getting your own basic service.</li>
                                    <li>Free Wi-Fi services. Another $50 to $100 a month if you had to buy your own service.</li>
                                    <li>You get to enjoy a host of recreational activities at the dorms, some of which have pool tables, ping pong tables, pianos, and many other fun things.</li>
                                    <li>Several of the Dorms have cafeterias, which are available to all students at UNT. Dining is available around the clock. If you have a Meal Plan, you have a host of cafeterias to select from, including Kerr Cafeteria, Bruce Cafeteria, Mean Green Cafeteria and many others</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                Some additional benefits to living the dorms,
                                <ul>
                                    <li>It is easier to commute to class, since you can choose your residence hall and accordingly, the proximity of your classes.</li>
                                    <li>It is easier to soak up the college atmosphere, since you live with so many students who might be sharing the same class as you.</li>
                                    <li>The campus provides a variety of facilities that will be closer for you, since you live on campus.</li>
                                    <li>The Willis library is an excellent place to study other than your dorm room.</li>
                                    <li>You get to enjoy events that happen at every Residence Hall, as well as make many friends as a result.</li>
                                    <li>Free bus services around Denton and UNT campus.</li>
                                </ul></p>

                                <h3>How possible is it to live close to campus?</h3>
                                <p>The best possible option to live close to campus is to live on campus. If you don&rsquo;t want to live in one of the residence halls, you can pick UNT-owned apartment complexes too, like Forum at Denton Station, College Inn and many others. For more information on these, look at: <a href="
                                https://offcampushousing.unt.edu/">Off Campus Housing</a><br />
                                <br />
                                However, if you want to avoid living in UNT-owned apartment complexes, you can check out any of the 45 apartment complexes within walking or biking distance to UNT. There are a multitude of apartment complexes to choose from around campus, there are 21 complexes on the Westside, eight complexes to the North, seven to the East, and nine to the South Eastside of campus. <br />
                                <br />
                                The Westside complexes tend to be a little older and have lower customer satisfaction ratings. Their prices are a little less and they offer few amenities. There are also fewer restaurants in this area. A major advantage to the Westside is the proximate to the I35 corridor.<br />
                                <br />
                                As you move towards the Eastside, the quality of life gets higher. The Eastside is considered ideal, due to Denton Square. There are many shops and restaurants, bars and clubs. Many people gather here after a long day at work and/or school. On the Eastside of campus you will find more five star rated apartment complexes that offer plenty of amenities.<br />
                                <br />
                                Here is what you can expect to find from living off campus in anyone of the apartments that are available. These numbers reflect the number of apartments that have a certain amenity to the total number of apartments not owned by UNT (45).  You can lookup specifics from <a href="www.apartmentfinder.com">Apartment Finder</a> or any similar rental search engine on the web. Eleven apartment complexes offer some sort of student special; however none of them offer any kind of military specials.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>39 apartment complexes that offer parking,</li>

                                    <li>5 apartment complexes with washer and dryer hookups</li>
                                    <li>1 apartment complex with an elevator</li>
                                </ul>
                                <b>Customer satisfaction</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>9 apartment complexes with a five star rating (mainly South East side)</li>
                                    <li>17 apartment complexes with a four star rating</li>
                                    <li>15 apartment complexes with a three star rating (mainly West side)</li>
                                </ul>
                                Living off campus definitely has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are that you can live as comfortably or as meagerly as you want. You can have a roommate if you want, you can choose the size your apartment, and can choose the distance you wish to travel every day. UNT has a host of buses to come to campus that are free of charge for UNT students. You can pick apartment complexes that fall on those routes for ease of travel to UNT.<br />

                                <h3>I understand that UNT offers a meal plan, what is the meal plan?</h3>
                                <p>The UNT Meal Plan is a plan offered by the University to students who wish to eat from one of the University&rsquo;s many cafeterias and retail dining options. It is a convenient way to avail of nutritious dining choices without burning a hole in your pocket. A meal plan is a must for freshmen and is optional for upperclassmen from some of the Residence Halls.<br />
                                <br />
                                This policy applies to Freshmen, regardless of whether they live on campus or off-campus: <a href="http://www.dining.unt.edu/residentpolicies">Resident Policies.</a> It is convenient that Freshmen select the Meal Plan, because the stress of your first year at University is always difficult, for most students. The Meal Plan is a convenient option to make sure you don&rsquo;t avoid meals and take a break from studying.<br />
                                <br />
                                It is optional for Transfer and Graduate students to purchase a meal plan, unless you live on campus at any one of the following halls: Crumley, Bruce, Clark, Kerr, Maple, McConnell, Traditions, Victory or West.<br />
                                <br />
                                Even upperclassmen who live at these halls must opt for some meal plan. The other residence hall upperclassmen are exempt from the compulsion of these meal plans.<br />

                                <h3>I live outside of Denton, what is the cost benefit to commuting to campus every day?</h3>
                                <p>Roughly one fourth the student population of UNT is classified as a non-traditional student and another one-fourth would be considered traditional students who travel. UNT is home to one of the largest commuting student populations in Texas. Because we are centrally located to Dallas and Fort Worth, many students decide to stay home and commute to school daily. The benefits for commuting can only be ascertained at the individual level. Each person has their own reasons for doing so. All we can do is provide measures to ensure your trips are safe.<br />
                                <br />
                                UNT provides three different levels of parking passes for commuters. General parking, Premium parking and Motorcycle parking passes are available through the transportation office. In addition to the parking passes, we have about 20 parking lots to choose from, plus miles of side streets, and two parking garages. Most of the lots have been recently resurfaced and additional lights have been added for your safety. In addition to the lights, several lots have emergency call boxes located on them. UNT police are ever vigilant as well. They do their part by patrolling the lots on a regular basis to ensure everyone is safe. Their patrols are ramped up during peak periods.<br />
                                <br />
                                Other services available for UNT students consist of carpooling programs, UNT shuttle services, and Denton County Transportation Services (DCTA). You can go to the UNT site <a href="www.alternetrides.com">Alternate Rides</a> and sign up for rideshare services. This site will match you with students who live in your area that are willing to split the cost for traveling to and from UNT on a daily basis. UNT shuttle services provide students rides from 7:15 am to 2 am Monday through Friday. You can gather more information on stops and routes at <a href="www.unt.edu/transit">UNT Transit.</a> Finally, with a partnership with DCTA provides transportation to Denton, Hickory Creek, and the Greater Lewisville area for free by showing their student ID. Bus routes and schedules can be located at <a href="www.dcta.net">DCTA.</a></p>

                                <h3>What is the parking situation like at UNT?</h3>
                                <p>Over the past few years UNT has made strides to improve the parking quality for its students. They have built a new parking garage, repaved and resurfaced may parking lots. They have installed more lighting and emergency call boxes near several of the lots on campus. All with the intent to provide a safe environment for you.<br />
                                <br />
                                Like most businesses, parking comes at a premium. If you want the best parking spot, expect to pay for it, rather it be with time or money. UNT has 84 on-campus parking lots, two parking garages, and miles of side streets available for parking. If you are a commuter, you will need to arrive early to get a good spot. Generally speaking, from 11 am- 2 pm, parking at UNT is hard to come by.<br />
                                <br />
                                UNT offers seven different types of parking passes; however, unless you are faculty or staff, or can acquire a reserved pass, only five types of passes are available. The passes available for students attending UNT are: Reserved, Faculty/Staff Premium Commuter, General Commuter, Resident, and Motorcycle.<br />
                                <br />
                                Reserved (A) parking lots are paid spots and are reserved 24 hours a day. <br />
                                <br />
                                Faculty/Staff (D) parking lots are reserved for those individuals who work for the university. These spots are available to park in after 5pm. <br />
                                <br />
                                Premium Commuter (P) parking lots are the closest to the university for commuters. These passes will cost $225.00 per year.<br />
                                <br />
                                General Commuter (G) parking lots are the furthest away, and cost $135.00 per year.<br />
                                <br />
                                The Resident Student (R) parking lots are reserved for those students living in the dorms and cost $250.00 per year. Both G and R lots have parking restrictions imposed upon them during game days. A student can really save if they ride a motorcycle. The motorcycle pass (M) cost $105.00 per year.<br />
                                <br />
                                Meter Parking is located around the outskirts of UNT, predominately Hickory Street. People with disabilities can park in these spots, free of charge, providing they have an approved handicapped plaquard or plates, and a UNT parking pass.<br />

                                <h3>How can I participate in extracurricular activities, like clubs, which will help me to adjust to life at UNT?</h3>
                                <p>Life at any University is easier if you have friends. Finding someone with similar tastes is always helpful in bonding over those hobbies. There is a huge number of extracurricular clubs at UNT and they are quite active. Extra-curricular help reduce the burden felt by the student with regards studies since it helps get their mind off the stress.<br /> 
                                <br />
                                We understand that your transition to college life can be a little stressful. We believe that being part of a group or club can go a long way to help alleviate stress. There are plenty of clubs and student organization on campus and off. We have over 400 registered clubs at UNT. We have developed a means to help place you into a club or student organization if you so choose to do so. <br />
                                <br />
                                To find the club that is right for you, go to UNT website. In the center navigation bar select Campus Life. Under Campus Life, scroll down to Student Organizations and click on it. You will be directed to the  <a href="http://studentaffairs.unt.edu/student-organizations">Student Organization</a> page. On this page you will see a heading called OrgSync Profile. Click on the link to register. Once you register, you will be provided with a plethora of information regarding student events, clubs, and associations. Just select the items that interest you, and when an event becomes available, your calendar will be populated with the date, time, and location of the event. Plus you will receive an email notification.<br />
                                <br />
                                Maybe you are looking for a specific club. You may have heard about it, either from a friend, or students on campus, and you want more information. You can find this information from the same Student Organization page. This time select the &ldquo;About&rdquo; tab. Next look under the heading Search Student Organizations, then select the &ldquo;here&rdquo; link. You will be redirected to <a href="http://unt.orgsync.com/search">OrgSync</a> Student Activities page. From here, you can search for a specific club or organization, if known, or browse through the different categories.<br />
                                <br />
                                To find out more about an organization, just click on the category. A brief explanation of what each organization is will be displayed.

                                <br />
                                Now we know that UNT&rsquo;s student organizations do not represent everyone at UNT; however, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that a club cannot be created to suite your needs. New organizations are being started all the time, all you would have to do is follow the guidelines set forth under the Starting a New Organization heading of the Student Organization page. Let&rsquo;s say you are a Pastafarian, and you noticed that UNT doesn&rsquo;t have a club dedicated to the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and you have at least eight other colander wearing friends. Just submit an application to start a new club. You will have a grace period where the club will be under review, but afterwards, it will be added to the 400 plus student organizations.<br />
                                <br />
                                The point of all this is to have fun and enjoy your college experience.</p>

                                <h3>Where can I go to find employment on campus?</h3>
                                <p>Finding a job on campus can be done in a variety of different ways. The three easiest ways are the Human Resources page, Workforce Texas, and word of mouth.<br />
                                <br /> 
                                Students wishing to work at UNT will have to apply through the Human Resources page no matter what direction they take. You can easily locate them by going to the UNT homepage and on the center navigation bar hover over the About UNT tab. Next scroll down to the Employment & HR button. Select it. You will then be redirected to the <a href="https://hr.untsystem.edu">HR homepage.</a><br />
                                <br />
                                From here, you can set up an account with your resume and search the jobs available at UNT. The downside to this site, not all jobs are posted here. <br />
                                <br />
                                Several types of student jobs never get listed. You can find out about these types of jobs through word of mouth. Examples of jobs which come about through word of mouth are tutor positions at writing labs, and learning centers, and library positions. Most of the time, departments will solicit classes in their department for candidates, and send out mass email to the student body.<br />
                                <br />
                                Workforce Texas is an online service that list jobs all over Texas; however, you can use this resource to find jobs at UNT or TWU which is just down the road from UNT.<br />
                                <br />
                                UNT places job restrictions on it&rsquo;s students. University wide students are limited to a 20 hour work-week. Some students tend to work two jobs within the UNT system; however, recent policy changes are doing away with this.<br />
                                <br />
                                Types of jobs you could get depends several factors:<br />
                                <br />
                                <b>Freshman:</b><br />
                                Most incoming freshman are restricted from working their first semester at UNT, unless it is in the food service industry. Most of the jobs require a minimum GPA for their workers. These GPA requirements are all job dependent, i.e. working for the Learning Center as a Supplement Instructor requires a minimum GPA of 3.0 to be employed there.  Tutor positions that require higher GPA&rsquo;s want model students that can quickly and easily discuss the professors objectives.<br />
                                <br />
                                <b>Transfer Students:</b><br />
                                Transfer students generally do not have to wait a semester for employment; however, they are restricted to 20 hours a week.<br />
                                <br />
                                <b>Master&rsquo;s Students:</b><br />
                                Master&rsquo;s students have more job opportunities available to them. They can work as Teaching Assistants, Teaching Fellows, Graduate Assistants, Lab Administrators, and a myriad of other positions that are normally restricted from the undergraduate level.<br />
                                <br />
                                <b>International Students:</b><br />
                                International students can only work on campus and part-time, for not more than 20 hours per week. This restricts the kind of jobs they can do. They are forbidden from working off campus, so they have to find jobs on campus. Most of the jobs on campus are working at cafeterias, which provide one meal to the employees per 4 hour shift. This is a huge benefit to employees.<br />
                                <br />
                                Other than cafeteria or retail dining jobs, there are jobs as student assistants, which pay better and offer tuition waivers. However, these are limited in number.<br />
                                <br />
                                On-campus employment at UNT is plentiful. With the University Union officially being re-opened in Spring16, there are more jobs available. Just remember to look in the HR page under Job Applicants. Search for the jobs through Jobs at UNT, then apply for those you think you fit in.</p>

                                <h3>What are some ways to relax around campus?</h3>
                                <p>It all depends around how you relax, really. Relaxing around campus is a good way to beat the stress and help you unwind. There are many ways to relax around campus.<br />

                                If you relax playing sports or working out, UNT provides for a variety of recreational activities in that regard. The Pohl Recreation Center is open for students every day of the week (bar some holidays) at certain timings which students who are registered at UNT can use free of cost.

                                Other ways students can relax is by just walking around campus outside peak hours and taking in the beauty of UNT. The campus is 875 acres, so you won&rsquo;t run out of campus to explore soon. Or you can take a bus to Discovery Park and take in the beauty of that part of our campus.<br />
                                <br />
                                Denton is a beautiful town and a lot can be done to relax here. There&rsquo;s always the Square/Downtown Denton, with its plethora of unique shops like Atomic Candy, which is a perfect stress-buster.

                                <h3>How easy is it to find people to contact according to departments?</h3>
                                <p>Communicating within the UNT systems is pretty easy. Aside from picking up the phone and calling the department, students can simply send an email to their professors through the use of EagleConnect or Blackboard. If you do not know the name or email address of the person you are looking for you can simply search for them if you know their full name. It is possible to find people&rsquo;s email addresses in the &ldquo;To&rdquo; section on EagleConnect, which every person at UNT is associated with via their EUID. Sometimes communication via email can be slow.<br />
                                <br />
                                In situations where you need to get a hold of someone and they are not responding via email, simply call their department. Many times, the department listed on the person&rsquo;s contact has a phone number listed on it. It is possible to call that number and ask to be connected to the person in question. If you think that is too direct, you can go, in person, to the department and schedule an appointment with that individual. Most people will grant you an appointment at the earliest. It is better to schedule an appointment than call people up because that way, you respect a person&rsquo;s time, and makes sure you make it convenient for the both of you.</p>

                                <h3>How easy-to-use would you say UNT websites are?</h3>
                                <p>We&rsquo;ve heard people talk about how complicated UNT sites are for first time users, but they tend to get easier as you use them more often.<br />
                                <br />
                                The main UNT site is useful, but people say it can be hard to navigate sometimes. All of UNT&rsquo;s webpages are set up in the same format. The formats may differ in appearance from one college to another, but the concepts are the same. On the top of each page you will find a top navigation bar. This navigation bar is used for the most frequent task a student may use, such as <a href="https://my.unt.edu/psp/papd01/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=NTPA_GUEST">MyUNT</a>, <a href="http://eagleconnect.unt.edu">EagleConnect</a>, <a href="https://learn.unt.edu">Blackboard</a>, <a href="http://www.unt.edu/find-people-department.htm">People</a>, <a href="http://maps.unt.edu">Maps</a>, <a href="http://www.unt.edu/calendars-events.htm">Calendars</a>, <a href="https://www.applytexas.org/adappc/gen/c_start.WBX">Apply Now</a>, and a search feature.<br />

                                MyUNT is the main web portal for all those who have an active UNT account, people who are currently enrolled, or employed by UNT. MyUNT is a site which helps the student with registering for classes and paying fees. This site has more things for your personal than the main site.<br />
                                <br />
                                EagleConnect is our email exchange service, again, you must be affiliated with UNT to have an account. EagleConnect is a useful email ID provided by UNT which helps students get important emails and correspondence at. This is easy to use because it works similar to a Windows Live email ID and there&rsquo;s not much difference from other email IDs. It also helps with the useful &ldquo;To&rdquo; feature, which can find email addresses of any individual at UNT.<br />

                                The next important section, which changes from one page to the next, is the second navigation bar. This second navigation bar is used to provide specific information for the section you are in. For example, the main page has information about admission process, academics, research, athletics, and so on. Under each of these sections, you will find more pages to drill down to answer more specific questions.<br />
                                <br />
                                UNT systems is packed with information. Each page is intended to help you to find information or answer your questions. It can be daunting, especially since the site has well over 30 thousand pages, but once you get the hang of the architecture, UNT systems are pretty easy to use.

                                <h3>What is Blackboard and is it easy to use?</h3>
                                <p>Blackboard is a virtual learning environment and course management system implemented by most professors at UNT to make sure students understand what is expected of them and help display their grades.<br />
                                <br />
                                Blackboard is not UNT-owned but UNT makes use of Blackboard as part of its system. Blackboard is used to make announcements from the professor to the students. It can be used as a means to help students contact their colleagues outside of the classroom. Or as a collaboration tool on projects without needing to meet outside of class and Blackboard has a variety of other tools and features that students and professors can take advantage of; such as: 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>an internal email exchange service,</li>
                                    <li>grade book,</li>
                                    <li>syllabus,</li>
                                    <li>course content,</li>
                                    <li>reference material,</li>
                                    <li>online testing features,</li>
                                    <li>and many other features.</li>
                                </ul>

                                The basic features of Blackboard are easy to use, but as you delve into its more complex features, it gets a little difficult to find out where everything is. However, it is very convenient for grading students and giving weighted totals.<br />
                                <br />
                                Since its implementation, some professors have opted out of not using Blackboard and go the conventional way with grading students and giving out assignments, through the paper and pen method. Email is also another way to dissipate assignments.</p>
